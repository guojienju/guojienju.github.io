<h2><a style="color:black">Rendering 《图形绘制技术》</a> (2017 – Present)</h2>

<p style="margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0">
  Rendering is a fundamental component of computer graphics. At the highest level of abstraction, rendering is the process of converting a description of a three-dimensional scene into an image. Algorithms for animation, geometric modeling, texturing, and other areas of computer graphics all must pass their results through some sort of rendering process so that they can be made visible in an image. Rendering has become ubiquitous; from movies to games and beyond, it has opened new frontiers for creative expression, entertainment, and visualization. This course focuses on sampling, shading, and display aspects of computer graphics. Topics includes: camera models, light sources, materials, local illumination, global illumination, Monte Carlo method, volume rendering, etc.

<h2><a style="color:black">Introduction to Programming 《程序设计基础》</a> (2018 - Present)</h2>

<p style="margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0">
  "Introduction to Programming" is a foundational introductory course for undergraduate students in Computer Science and related disciplines. This course is problem-solving oriented, designed to help students build an understanding of programming, comprehend computational models, and develop the ability to implement algorithms and data structures. Based on the procedural programming paradigm and using C/C++ as the medium, the course emphasizes methods of flow control, modular design, and the description of data and operations within a program, along with the corresponding skills training for each component. Through the analysis of case studies, assignments, and projects, students are progressively guided to solve problems by designing C/C++ programs. The course also emphasizes the cultivation of good programming habits and provides students with constructive feedback.
