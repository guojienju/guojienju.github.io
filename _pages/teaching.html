  Rendering is a fundamental component of computer graphics. At the highest level of abstraction, rendering is the process of converting a description of a three-dimensional scene into an image. Algorithms for animation, geometric modeling, texturing, and other areas of computer graphics all must pass their results through some sort of rendering process so that they can be made visible in an image. Rendering has become ubiquitous; from movies to games and beyond, it has opened new frontiers for creative expression, entertainment, and visualization. This course focuses on sampling, shading, and display aspects of computer graphics. Topics includes: camera models, light sources, materials, local illumination, global illumination, Monte Carlo method, volume rendering, etc.
